## Disclaimer  
- **This module is optimized for custom ROMs (AOSP) on the Nothing Phone 2.**  
  Flashing it on stock/GSI/port ROMs is not recommended and may cause issues, as it disables multiple background services.  

## Features  
- Disables unnecessary GMS background processes for better performance and battery life.  
- Allows enabling/disabling GMS services without rebooting.  
- Includes an action button for cleaning cached GMS data.  
- Recommended to remove other performance/CPU/Gaming-related Magisk modules before flashing.  
- **Requires Magisk 27008+ for the action button to function correctly.**  

## Checking GMS Status  
1. Try opening Quick Share from the Quick Settings Panel.  
2. If it doesn’t open, GMS processes are disabled.  
3. If it opens, GMS processes are enabled.  

You can toggle GMS services as needed using the **Action button**.
