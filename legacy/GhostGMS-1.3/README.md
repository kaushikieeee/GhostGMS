## Disclaimer  
- **This module is optimized for custom ROMs (AOSP) on the Nothing Phone 2.**  
  Flashing it on stock/GSI/port ROMs is not recommended and may cause issues, as it disables multiple background services.  

## Features  
- Disables unnecessary GMS background processes for better performance and battery life.  
- Allows enabling/disabling GMS services without rebooting.  
- Includes an action button for cleaning cached GMS data.  
- Recommended to remove other performance/CPU/Gaming-related Magisk modules before flashing.  
- **Requires Magisk 27008+ for the action button to function correctly.**  

## Checking GMS Status  
1. Try opening Quick Share from the Quick Settings Panel.  
2. If it doesnâ€™t open, GMS processes are disabled.  
3. If it opens, GMS processes are enabled.  

You can toggle GMS services as needed using the **Action button**.
